In comparatively Kite have low complexity & low learning curve. It can be integrate with any project easily. Kite have some limited features which leads fast development without extra learning curve. Any one can use it who have knowledge of basic concepts of SQL.\r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\nI was working a mid size project having 30 tables in database. I used Hibernate with JPA wrapper in architecture of framework. Unfortunately all team members are freshers & Hibernate itself a high learning curve. So management suggested to use JDBC instead of Hibernate. So I realized there is need of simple ORM  framework which have very less learning curve. then I created Kite which have very less learning curve.\r\n\r\n### Requirement\r\nFor using Kite framework you must have using jdk 1.5 or higher version.\r\nKite will not support on jdk1.4 or lower version.\r\n\r\n### What Kite Framework does?\r\nKite framework gives flexibility to direct dealing with objects instead of writing sql queries.\r\nif you are using Kite framework, you don't need to write sql quries in dao layer. Kite provides all CRUD operations & finders also.\r\n\r\n### How Kite Framework works?\r\nKite framework is based of some configuration, which can be defined in Entity class itself by using Kite's Annotation Classes. Kite used Annotation's & Bean Utilities for exposing objects.\r\nFor more information & examples you can visit: [API Docs](http://kite-orm.net63.net/docs/) & [Examples](http://kite-framework.blogspot.in/p/examples.html)\r\n\r\n### Targets in next version releases\r\nIn this Version 1.0 only basic functionality has been introduced which is CRUD operations & finders.\r\nKite have following key point introduced in next release:\r\n* strong Object mapping\r\n* foreign key reference support\r\n* Early or Lazy loading\r\n* Restriction for Objects\r\n* integration with other frameworks \r\n\r\n_Next version 2.0 may be released in mid of September 2012._\r\n\r\n### About Author & Contributors\r\nDeepak Garg is author of this Open Source Project.
